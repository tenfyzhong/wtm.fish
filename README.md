## Features

- üéØ **Interactive Selection** - Browse and switch between worktrees with fzf
- üå≥ **Smart Worktree Management** - Create, remove, and list worktrees with ease
- üîÑ **File Syncing** - Optionally sync staged/modified/untracked files when creating new worktrees
- üßπ **Auto Cleanup** - Remove stale worktrees based on age, skipping those with uncommitted changes
- ü™ù **Custom Hooks** - Run project-specific (`.wtm_hook.fish`) or global (`~/.config/wtm/hook.fish`) scripts after worktree creation

- üé® **Beautiful UI** - Colorful and informative terminal interface

## Requirements

- Fish shell v4.0+
- Git v2.5+ (with worktree support)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (for interactive selection)

## Installation

### Using Fisher

```fish
fisher install ktym4a/wtm.fish
```

### Manual Installation

```fish
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ktym4a/wtm.fish.git ~/.config/fish/wtm.fish
# Source the functions
ln -s ~/.config/fish/wtm.fish/functions/wtm.fish ~/.config/fish/functions/
ln -s ~/.config/fish/wtm.fish/completions/wtm.fish ~/.config/fish/completions/
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

Simply run `wtm` without arguments to interactively select and switch between worktrees:

```fish
wtm
```

This opens an fzf interface showing:

- All available worktrees
- Current branch status
- Changed files
- Recent commits

### Create a New Worktree

Worktrees are stored in the `.git/wtm_data/` directory of your repository.

```fish
# Create from main branch (default)
wtm add feature/new-feature
# Create from specific base branch
wtm add hotfix/urgent-fix --base develop
# Create a worktree from an existing branch
wtm add existing-feature-branch
# Create and sync current changes
wtm add feature/continue-work --sync
```

### Open a Worktree

The `open` subcommand provides similar functionality to the interactive mode but allows specifying a branch directly. It's useful for scripting or when you know exactly which worktree you want to open.

```fish
# Open the worktree of the current feature/feature-1
wtm open feature/feature-1
```

### Remove a Worktree

```fish
# Interactive selection
wtm remove
# Remove specific branch
wtm remove feature/old-feature
```

### List All Worktrees

```fish
wtm list
```

### Clean Stale Worktrees

Removes worktrees that are older than a specified number of days and have no uncommitted changes.

```fish
# Remove worktrees older than 30 days (default)
wtm clean
# Remove worktrees older than 7 days
wtm clean --days 7
# Preview what would be removed
wtm clean --dry-run
```

### Switch to Main Branch

```fish
wtm main
```

### Initialize Hook Template

Create a `.wtm_hook.fish` file in the current repository for project-specific hooks.

```fish
wtm init
```

## Command Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `wtm` | Interactive worktree selection with fzf |
| `wtm add <branch>` | Create new worktree, and a new branch if it doesn't exist |
| `wtm remove [<branch>]` | Remove worktree and branch |
| `wtm list` | List all worktrees |
| `wtm clean` | Clean up stale worktrees with no uncommitted changes |
| `wtm init` | Create a project-specific hook template (`.wtm_hook.fish`) |
| `wtm main` | Switch to main/master branch |
| `wtm open [<branch>]` | Open existing worktree (interactive if no branch specified) |

### Global Options

- `-h, --help` - Show help message
- `-v, --verbose` - Enable verbose output
- `-q, --quiet` - Suppress informational output

### Add Options

- `-b, --base <branch>` - Base branch (default: main)
- `--sync` - Sync staged/modified/untracked files from current branch
- `--no-hook` - Skip hook execution (.wtm_hook.fish or global hook)

### Clean Options

- `-n, --dry-run` - Show what would be removed
- `--days <n>` - Remove worktrees older than n days (default: 30)

## Hook System

The hook system allows you to run custom commands after creating a new worktree. This is useful for:

- Copying environment files
- Installing dependencies
- Setting up symlinks
- Running initialization scripts

### Hook Priority

`wtm.fish` looks for a hook file in the following order, executing the first one it finds:

1. **Project-specific hook**: `.wtm_hook.fish` in the root of your Git repository.
2. **Global hook**: `~/.config/wtm/hook.fish`.
If a project-specific hook is found, the global hook is ignored.

### Example Hook File

After running `wtm init`, customize `.wtm_hook.fish` for project-specific tasks. For global tasks, create and edit `~/.config/wtm/hook.fish`.

```fish
#!/usr/bin/env fish
# Copy environment files
for env_file in .env .env.local
    if test -f "$WTM_PROJECT_ROOT/$env_file"
        cp "$WTM_PROJECT_ROOT/$env_file" "$WTM_WORKTREE_PATH/"
        echo "[COPY] $env_file"
    end
end
# Create symlink for node_modules
if test -d "$WTM_PROJECT_ROOT/node_modules"
    ln -s "$WTM_PROJECT_ROOT/node_modules" "$WTM_WORKTREE_PATH/node_modules"
    echo "[LINK] node_modules"
end
```

### Available Hook Variables

- `$WTM_WORKTREE_PATH` - Path to the new worktree
- `$WTM_BRANCH_NAME` - Name of the created branch
- `$WTM_BASE_BRANCH` - Base branch used for creation
- `$WTM_PROJECT_ROOT` - Path to the original project root
- `$WTM_TIMESTAMP` - Timestamp of worktree creation

## Workflow Examples

### Feature Development

```fish
# Start new feature
wtm add feature/user-authentication
# Work on the feature...
# Switch to another task
wtm add hotfix/login-bug
# Go back to feature
wtm  # Select interactively
# Clean up when done
wtm remove feature/user-authentication
```

### Parallel Development

```fish
# Create multiple feature branches
wtm add feature/ui-redesign
wtm add feature/api-v2
wtm add feature/documentation
# Switch between them instantly
wtm  # Use fzf to select
# See all active work
wtm list
# Clean up old branches
wtm clean --days 14
```
